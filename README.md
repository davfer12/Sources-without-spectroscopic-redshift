# Sources-without-spectroscopic-redshift
This repository contains a table in csv format with all sources within our Astrogeo VLBI sample that have no spectroscopic redshift measurement.
The table has 5059 sources and 3 columns. The columns contain the J2000 name, the RA and DEC coordinates. We encourage the redshift measurement of these sources so that they can be included in a future analysis.
